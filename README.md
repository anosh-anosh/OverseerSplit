# OverseerSplit
a split low profile ortho 60-key keyboard designed for a project i'm working on - a small, rugged cyberdeck, called the Overseer.

this is not a vertically staggered keyboard. it's like a planck that's split in half basically. Actually, it's inspired by the [splitish](https://github.com/RSchneyer/splitish), but i made this from scratch to my prefrence because i didn't really find anything on the internet that fit what i was looking for.

this keyboard's PCB has a huge notch in the middle where i am able to fit something. i haven't finished designing everything yet, so we'll have to see. it'll either be a scrollwheel or a trackball. or, maybe it'll be a small display. i'll update this when i decide on what will go there.
